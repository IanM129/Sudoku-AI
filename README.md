## How to start:
- Step by step:
  - create_venv.bat (creates a python virtual environment in the current folder)
  - install_requirements.bat (installs all required modules (~1.2 gb) inside the venv) 
  - run.bat (runs the program (interface_v1.py), generally used to quickly run the program)
- All at once:
  - all_in_one.bat (does every step in a single console)
